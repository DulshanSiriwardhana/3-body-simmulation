# High-Precision 3-Body Gravitational Simulation

A React-based simulation of the three-body problem with high-precision arithmetic, auto-zoom functionality, and extreme speed control (up to 1000x).

## Features

- **High-precision arithmetic** using custom Decimal class
- **Auto-zoom camera** that keeps all bodies visible
- **Extreme speed control** from 0.1x to 1000x simulation speed
- **Verlet integration** for numerical stability
- **Real-time trails** with customizable length
- **Interactive controls** for all simulation parameters
- **Grid reference** system for spatial awareness
- **Performance optimizations** for high-speed simulation
